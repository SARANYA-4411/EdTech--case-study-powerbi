After analyzing the dataset, I found the 


following insights:

The conversion rate of leads to awareness, consideration, and conversion stages is 1547,331,64,250 respectively.

The most common reasons for lack of interest at each stage are as follows:
Lead Stage: Not interested in further discussion
Awareness Stage: Not interested in the product
Consideration Stage: Looking for other options
Conversion Stage: High cost of the product



The most common reasons for unsuccessful calls at each stage are as follows:
Lead Stage: Lead not interested
Awareness Stage: Call not answered
Consideration Stage: Call not answered
Conversion Stage: Call not answered




There are some outliers in the dataset, such as leads that have moved from the lead stage to the conversion stage within a day, which should be excluded from the analysis.




Based on these insights, I built a suitable dashboard to present my findings. The dashboard includes visualizations of conversion rates, lead journey timelines, reasons for lack of interest, sales managers' performance, and demo session watched percentages.

My recommendations are backed by data insights and professional visualizations that can help the business team design road maps, strategies, and action items to achieve their goals.
